# Music-Movers


Music Movers is a music interpretation social media application where users can look at song lyrics and post their own interpretation of the lyrics. 


# Instructions for User Interface:
When the user opens the web application, they will be directed to a home page prompting them to login or sign up for an account. The user will then be directed to the search page, where they can search for a song name. By clicking the song name, the user will be directed to the songs page. This page shows the lyrics to the song, artist name, current lyric interpretations and a form to submit an interpretation.
